# Configuration-file for pre-commit
# References:
#   - Official docs: https://pre-commit.com
#   - for more hooks: https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html
#
# To avoid duplication, we try to configure the tools in pyproject.toml as much as possible.
#
# We prepend "poetry run" to every command to make it work without activatig the python-virtualenv
#
# Usage:
#   > bin/pre-commit install
#   > bin/pre-commit install hooks  -f
#   > bin/pre-commit autoupdate
#   > bin/pre-commit run --all-files
